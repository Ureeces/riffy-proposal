# Riffy Proposal

* Dice Roller App
  
This app takes in two numbers, an amount of dice to be rolled and the number of sides
each dice has. It randomly generates an amount values equal to the amount specified by the user, each ranging from 1-the dice maximum. It then calculates the total of these values and displays the calculation and the total to the user. 

### Stretch Goals:
* Dice Recognizer - Will attempt to recognize what your purpose is depending on the kind of 
die you use (Ex: Recognizes if you're rolling a 6 sided-die, or rolling for character stats in a tabletop RPG)
* Comments for roll(Gives user sympathy on bad rolls, Congratulations on good rolls, etc.)
  * Have multiple comments for each outcome, and randomly sends one to the user
* Allow a third input that adds or subtracts a constant from the total
* Display messages for incorrect input/usage
